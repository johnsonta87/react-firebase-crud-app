## React Booking Project

This project integrates [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) authentication with React and Material UI. The project uses Cloud Firestore to manage noSQL database of users and entries and [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/) to manage and deliver media files.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
